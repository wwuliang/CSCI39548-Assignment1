    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at CUNY Hunter College ðŸŽ“ pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic journey reflects my deep interest in the convergence of technology and media. 

I am passionate about human-computer interaction with a direct interest in full-stack web development ðŸ’» and crafting seamless user experiences through UX/UI design where I enjoy creating immersive digital experiences. Beyond the digital world, I am an avid consumer of films ðŸŽ¬, television ðŸ“º, and other forms of media ðŸ“°, which inspire my approach to storytelling and design. 

I aspire to bridge the gap between technology and narrative, using my knowledge to create engaging digital solutions.

Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email at williamwuliang22@gmail.com. I'm open to collaboration and always eager to learn and grow in this dynamic field. ðŸ”—âœ¨
